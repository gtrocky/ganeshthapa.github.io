  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I grew up close to nature and have always been curious about how people and the environment shape one another. That curiosity led me to study economics and eventually to work that spans environmental policy, spatial analysis, and program evaluation. I enjoy research that is rigorous, practical, and directly useful to decision‑makers.</p>
  <p>These days I live in Wisconsin and spend a lot of time thinking about public lands, recreation, and water. Off the clock you’ll usually find me with family, on a lakeside walk, or reading non‑fiction with a cup of coffee nearby.</p>
