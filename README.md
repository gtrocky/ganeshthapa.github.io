# Personal Site — Ganesh Thapa

## Publish for Free with GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repo named `yourusername.github.io`.
2. Upload all files/folders from this zip (keep structure).
3. Repo → Settings → Pages → Deploy from Branch (main).
4. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Customize
- Replace `assets/profile-placeholder.jpg` with your photo (same filename).
- Put your CV and papers in `files/` (e.g., `files/cv.pdf`, `files/cwd_paper.pdf`). Update research links accordingly.
- Colors & layout live in `assets/styles.css`.

## Optional: Custom Domain (still free to use with GitHub Pages)
- Add a `CNAME` file at the repo root containing your domain (e.g., `www.example.com`).
- In your DNS, CNAME `www` → `yourusername.github.io` and enable HTTPS.
